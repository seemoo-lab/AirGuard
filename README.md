**Protect yourself from Find My Tracking**

The AirTags and other Find My devices are simple, small and perfect to track Android users! 
Without tracking warnings, as integrated on iOS, anyone could try to track your behavior by placing an AirTag in your jacket, backpack or car. 

With AirGuard you get the anti-tracking protection you deserve! 
The app periodically scans your surroundings for potential tracking devices, like AirTags or other Find My devices. 
If a devices follows you, you will get a notification in less than an hour! 

With the app you can play a sound on AirTags and find it easily. Afterward, you can view at which locations the device has tracked you. 

If no one is trying to track you, the app will never bother you. 

###  Who are we? 
We are part of the Technical University of Darmstadt in Germany. This project is part of a scientific research from the Secure Mobile Networking Lab. Our goal is to protect privacy and to find out how many people are opposed to tracking.
In this app you can voluntarily participate in a research study that will share anonymized data with us. 

This app will never get monetized by showing ads, in-app purchases or anything else.
