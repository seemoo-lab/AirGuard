With AirGuard, you get the anti-stalking protection you deserve!
The app scans your surroundings in the background to detect trackers like AirTags, Samsung SmartTags, or Google Find My Device trackers. If a tracker is following you, you will receive an instant notification.

These trackers are often no larger than a coin and are unfortunately misused to secretly track people. Since each tracker works differently, you would typically need multiple apps to detect unwanted tracking.
AirGuard combines the detection of various trackers into a single app – keeping you protected with ease.

Once a tracker is detected, you can make it play a sound (for supported models) or perform a manual scan to locate it. If you find a tracker, we recommend disabling it to prevent further tracking of your location.

The app stores location data exclusively on your device, allowing you to review where a tracker has followed you. Your personal data is never shared.

If no trackers are found, the app runs silently in the background and won’t bother you.

<h2><b>How does the app work?</b></h2>
AirGuard uses Bluetooth to detect AirTags, Samsung SmartTags, and other trackers. All data is processed and stored locally on your device.
If a tracker is detected in at least three different locations, you will receive a warning. You can adjust the security level in the settings to receive even faster alerts.

<h2><b>Who are we?</b></h2>
We are part of the Technical University of Darmstadt. This project is part of the scientific research conducted by the Secure Mobile Networking Lab.
Our goal is to protect people’s privacy and investigate how widespread the issue of tracker-based stalking is.

You can voluntarily participate in an anonymous study to help us gain more insights into the usage and spread of these trackers.

This app will never be monetized – there are no ads and no paid features. You will never be charged for using it.
