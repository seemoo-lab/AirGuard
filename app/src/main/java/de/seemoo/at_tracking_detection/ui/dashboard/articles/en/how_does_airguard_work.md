# How Does AirGuard Work?

Smart item trackers use Bluetooth to connect to foreign devices. These devices then send their location to the Internet. As a result of that, the owner of the smart item tracker can then see the location of the tracker even if it is miles away.

Thats's why these smart item trackers can be abused to stalk people. To protect you against such an attack, AirGuard uses Bluetooth to scan for nearby trackers. The app uses your location to detect if a tracker moves with you.

If AirGuard detects a suspicious tracker, you will receive a notification with more detailed information.
