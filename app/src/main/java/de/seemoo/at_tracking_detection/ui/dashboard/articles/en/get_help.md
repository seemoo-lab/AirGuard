# If You Received a Notification
### Find help by professionals if someone tracks you

If AirGuard detects a tracker in the background which follows you, you will receive a notification. You can tap on the notification to learn more about this tracker. For supported trackers, you can play a sound to locate the tracker. For all other trackers, you can use \"Locate Tracker\" to find it.

If you found the tracker and you are certain that it is malicious, try to remove the battery. Also make sure you don't move to another location until you disabled it.

In the unfortunate event that you found a tracker that was used against you, it is important to know where to get help.
There are several networks and associations that can help you. We provide a short list by country.
