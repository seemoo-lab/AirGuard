# Limitations of This App

AirGuard can only find Bluetooth-based trackers. Trackers that work with GPS and share the location with the owner via a cellular connection cannot be found.

In the following, you will learn which trackers AirGuard can automatically detect in the background and which trackers are visible using the manual scan.

**Samsung SmartTags**
These tags are made by Samsung and work almost the same as AirTags.

**Tile Tracker**
Tile is a company that exclusively makes Bluetooth trackers. These also have similar features to AirTags.

**Chipolo Tracker (without Find My)**
Chipolo offers Find My trackers that only work with iPhones and trackers that also work with Android devices. Here we cover the trackers that are also compatible with Android phones.

*Manual scan* ✅

**AirTags**
AirTags are Apple's trackers. As a result, they are only detectable to a limited extent, as many signals are filtered by the system. In the manual scan we can find AirTags and you can locate them. Tracking detection in the background is already provided by the Apple Find My App.

**Find My Tracker**
These are trackers that are compatible with Apple's Find My, but come from other manufacturers. There are a few manufacturers that make such trackers: Chipolo, Pebblebee, Atuvos, etc. As with AirTags, the tracker cannot be detected in the background. Again, the Find My app automatically warns you.

Note that it is not currently possible for all tracker typed to determine whether they are connected to their owner. Thus, you might see your own or friends' trackers.
Also, it's important to know that some trackers randomly change their identity (Bluetooth MAC address) a couple of times a day. As a result, one tracker could be displayed multiple times in the app. That's because it's often not possible to match the different, randomized identities.
